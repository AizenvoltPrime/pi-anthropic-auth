// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Upstream prompt drift check
//
// `src/constants.ts` holds strings and section names copied verbatim out of
// pi's default system prompt.  Nothing else in the suite verifies they still
// match the installed pi, so drift surfaces at request time — a `console.warn`
// on stderr mid-session when no section is recognized, and silence when only
// one anchor goes stale.
//
// This is the one file in the suite that deliberately imports a Pi internal
// rather than building a fixture inline (see AGENTS.md Testing Guidance):
// depending on the internal *is* the verification.
//
// If pi restructures its `dist/` layout, the import above throws and this file
// reds with a resolution error rather than a drift message.  That is intended:
// "the anchors can no longer be verified" is as blocking as "the anchors
// drifted", and both should stop a dependency bump.
